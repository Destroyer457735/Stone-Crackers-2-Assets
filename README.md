# Stone Crackers 2 Assets
Assets for my game "Stone Crackers 2" on penguin mod. (Link to penguin mod : https://penguinmod.com/)
The project will (eventually) be able to be remixed here but not on penguin mod.
Reasoning for this is because it isn't possible to see inside to prevent cheating.
When in the editor, the save sprit will be deleted right after progress has been saved.

# IMPORTANT!
This game is still in development!
I will be making desktop versions of this via the packager.
The desktop version will be on a seprate repo. If the servers are still down once I have a stable version, desktop will most likely come first.
